## Lay Summary

> Multimorbidity refers to the coexistence of two or more long-term health conditions and its prevalence is set to rise with ageing populations and improved life expectancy. Multimorbidity is not well understood, and the clinical management of individuals is complex. Patients often receive treatment for each condition in isolation, resulting in multiple visits to different specialists and complicated drug regimes. Treatment in this form represents a burden for both the individual and the healthcare system. My research aims to utilise Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to develop models that can identify the most probable subsequent disease based on an individual’s health history. My research plan includes using computer algorithms to process the large quantities of information within EHR data to manageable amounts without losing important signals. I will also explore methods that can account for time-ordered and repeated measurements of patients’ health information to further improve disease prognosis prediction. Finally, I will identify patient subgroups that exhibit similar disease trajectories. The formulated prediction models can give insight into disease progression pathways and appropriate patient groupings. This has pertinent applications within clinical practice in managing and prescribing appropriate treatment for patients with multimorbidity.
