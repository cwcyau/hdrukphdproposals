## Lay Summary

**Before:** 

> As of 2019, stroke was the third-leading cause of deaths and disability globally. It has been shown that we can better rehabilitate stroke patients through non-invasive brain stimulation methods, such as targeted memory reactivation (TMR). If we trigger TMR during sleep using a phenomenon known as memory replay, we have reason to believe that rehabilitation outcomes will be even better. In order to do this, we need to work on detecting memory replay in low density EEG sleep datasets. Our approach will involve first improving on existing methods to detect replay in MEG data – the way it is done currently – and then adapting our methods to work on high density, and eventually low density, EEG sleep data. This is the type of data that we can get from wearable devices that people use at home. This work will not only contribute to a small but growing body of knowledge on memory replay, but will also form the foundation for better rehabilitation of stroke patients in a clinical setting.

**After:**

> Memory replay is a phenomenon which has been studied extensively in rodents, and less so in humans, only in an awake state. Detecting memory replay in sleep, specifically using EEG data from at-home wearable technology, would have two benefits. Firstly, it would represent an advancement of basic neuroscience, allowing us to monitor replay over multiple nights in natural settings during sleep and rest, providing new insights into both replay and sleep. Secondly, we could use this approach to determine the best time point in sleep to trigger a technique known as targeted memory reactivation (TMR), which has been shown to improve rehabilitation of stroke patients. Our approach will involve first improving on existing methods to detect replay in MEG data – the way it is done currently – and then adapting our methods to work on high-density, and eventually low-density, EEG sleep data. This is the type of data that we can get from wearable devices that people use at home. This work will not only contribute to a small but growing body of knowledge on memory replay, but will also form the foundation for better rehabilitation of stroke patients in a clinical setting.
