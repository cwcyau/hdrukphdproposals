## Lay Summary

**Before:** 

> Clinical prediction models are a tool used by clinicians and patients to assess individual risk of various health outcomes. With modern advances in machine learning and ‘big data’, it is increasingly important that new models which are deployed are able to be monitored for reduced performance over time (drift), as well as updated if the need arises. I hope to further methodology which helps to mitigate the effect of decreased model performance over time (drift). For example, it is of interest to know how often a model should be updated over its lifespan. Model performance drift will be characterised both from a methodological perspective, as well as on a real world example where the COVID19 pandemic may have been a substantial attenuating factor in declining performance. The hope is that as literature surrounding clinical prediction models evolves to consider performance over time more substantially in the planning stage, my research will help to inform decision making, ensuring that patient outcomes are prioritised.

I hope to further methodology which helps to mitigate the effect of decreased model performance over time (drift). For example, it is of interest to know how often a model should be updated over its lifespan. Strategies for dealing with model performance drift will be developed, with particular focus paid on a real world example where the COVID-19 pandemic may have been a substantial contributing factor in declining performance. A model predicting emergency admission in Scotland has been chosen as a motivating example, due to its widespread coverage and use in clinical practice. The hope is that as literature surrounding clinical prediction models evolves to consider performance over time more substantially in the planning stage, my research will help to provide more accurate information to clinicians and patients, enabling better decisions to be made.
