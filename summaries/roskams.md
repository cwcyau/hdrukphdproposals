## Lay Summary

**Before:** 

> Identifying mechanisms by which DNA variants causally impact trait remains one of the fundamental questions in human genetics and is largely unanswered for complex disease phenotypes. Uncovering these could help guide treatment plans for complex diseases as well as understand fundamentally how different traits develop and persist in the general population. Many approaches have attempted to tackle this problem, but fall short in terms of certainty, causality, or practicality. We propose a new method using targeted learning, termed TarGene, to identify groups of variants that act together and contribute to acute COVID-19 severity, as well as the molecular mechanism through which they act. To this aim, we will identify (i) variants that significantly alter binding of a transcription factor, (ii) additional variants that interact with and modulate this transcription factor and (iii) a causal association of this interaction with outcome (specifically, acute COVID-19 severity). Additionally, we will propose a candidate transcriptional mechanism associated with these interactions, as well as the relevant cell (sub)type/state. We hope to identify new candidate therapeutic targets to treat critical COVID-19 and provide a proof-of-principle for this approach, which will be applied to other complex disease settings in the future.

**After:**

> We aim to uncover the biological mechanisms that hinder patient response to COVID-19 infection. To do so, we hypothesize that complex traits, like COVID-19 severity, are driven by many genetic variants across the genome that interact with each other through various biological mechanisms. This kind of interaction is called epistasis, and the many ways these variants can interact cause the diverse spectrum of possible outcomes that we see in complex traits. However, investigating all such mechanisms is infeasible, and so we choose to focus on a specific mechanism by which this can occur, namely binding of a transcription factor to a region of the DNA that contains a genetic variant. Briefly, transcription factors are proteins which bind to the DNA and regulate the expression of many downstream genes, defining how these cells function, or in the case of disease, how they misfunction. We will use a new statistical method, termed TarGene, which provides mathematical guarantees when modelling the effect of these interacting variants on acute COVID-19 severity, which no other method can currently do. Further, we hope to identify genes impacted by this transcription factor binding to help us understand the fundamental biology behind the range in response to COVID-19 infection. This will provide a proof-of-principle for our approach, which will then be applied to other complex disease settings.
