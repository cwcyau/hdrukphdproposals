## Lay Summary

**Before:** 

> Target-based drug discovery is a leading approach in the development of new medicines, in which modulating the function of a target protein is hypothesized to be therapeutically beneficial. The typical approach is to search for molecules that will bind with the target, thereby changing the protein’s function. Identifying lead molecules is typically done by experimentally testing thousands of known drug-like molecules or molecular fragments to see if they bind with the target protein. The problem is that the number of possible drug-like molecules is estimated to be in the range 1023 to 10100 [Hilten 2019] therefore experimentally testing all of them is impossible and the task of building new molecules from fragments requires extensive expert knowledge and intuition. The biological function and behaviour of proteins and molecules are governed by the structure and chemical properties of the molecules. As a result, it is possible to predict the location of binding sites and which molecules are likely to bind. This project proposes to use machine learning on structural representations of proteins and molecules to guide the process of target identification and molecular search to come up with new clinically relevant targets and new molecules that can be used as therapeutics.

**After:**

> Proteins are responsible for most of the complexity required for life and therefore proteins play a role in every human disease. Target-based drug discovery is a leading approach in the development of new medicines, in which we try and identify a protein where we can modulate its function using drugs and achieve a therapeutic benefit. The typical approach is to search for molecules that will bind to the protein in a relevant target site, thereby changing the protein’s function. There are far too many possible molecules to experimentally test them all (there are more potential drug-like molecules than there are atoms in the solar system), so we need efficient ways to search for good candidates. This project proposes to develop software, powered by machine learning, that allows us to take any protein target, and quickly generate candidate molecules that are likely to bind. These molecules can then be tested in the lab and subsequently go on to clinical trials. Improving the early stages of the drug discovery pipeline in this way can help the discovery of new medicines for all diseases from cancer to viral infections.
