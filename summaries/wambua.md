## Lay Summary

**Before:** 

> Women with complications during pregnancy (for example pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes) are likely to develop heart conditions, diabetes and, high blood pressure later in life. This leads to high costs in management of the conditions and affects the women, their families and the NHS. Identifying pregnant women who are likely to develop these conditions after childbirth is important in developing strategies to reduce the burden of these conditions in this population. In this PhD research project I will use information from scientific literature to identify pregnancy complications which are linked to future risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. I will then use the identified pregnancy factors alongside other patient characteristics (for example age, socio-economic status and medical history) to develop algorithms (computer models) that calculate the likelihood of having the conditions 10 years after childbirth. These tools will inform further research and help General Practitioners (GPs) in managing the conditions, referrals and advising women on their choices and decisions.

**After:**

> Women with complications during pregnancy (for example pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)) are likely to develop heart conditions, diabetes and, high blood pressure later in life. For example, studies have shown that GDM affects 2 to 6 out of 100 pregnant women and those with a history of the condition have 2.3-fold and 10-fold increased risk of future heart condition and diabetes respectively. This affects patients, their families and leads to high costs in management of the health conditions. Identifying pregnant women who are likely to develop these conditions after childbirth is important in developing strategies to improve the health, treatment and care for women who have experienced these conditions. In this PhD research project, I will use information from scientific literature to identify pregnancy complications which are linked to future risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. I will then use the identified pregnancy complications alongside other patient characteristics (for example age, socio-economic status and medical history) to develop and test the accuracy of algorithms (computer models) that calculate the likelihood of having the conditions 10 years after childbirth. These tools will inform further research and help General Practitioners (GPs) in managing the conditions, referrals and advising women on their choices and decisions.
